# SmartFalcon Internship - Hyperledger Fabric Assignment

## Overview

This project is developed as part of the SmartFalcon internship program. The objective is to create a blockchain-based system using Hyperledger Fabric to manage and track financial assets. The system supports asset creation, updating asset values, querying the world state, and retrieving transaction history, ensuring security, transparency, and immutability of asset records.

## Technologies Used

- **Hyperledger Fabric**: A permissioned blockchain framework.
- **Golang**: Programming language used for developing the smart contract.
- **Node.js**: Environment for running the REST API.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for running the application.
- **GitHub**: Version control for source code management.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/buntyanvi/SmartFalconInternship.git
   cd SmartFalconInternship
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for the REST API**:

   ```bash
   cd rest-api
   npm install
   ```

3. **Ensure Docker is installed and running** on your machine.

## Setup Instructions

### Hyperledger Fabric Test Network

1. **Navigate to the Hyperledger Fabric test network directory**:

   ```bash
   cd hyperledger-fabric-test-network
   ```

2. **Start the test network**:

   ```bash
   ./network.sh up
   ```

3. **Deploy the smart contract**:

   ```bash
   ./network.sh deployCC
   ```

### REST API

1. **Build the Docker image** for the REST API:

   ```bash
   docker build -t rest-api .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 rest-api
   ```

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is implemented in **Golang** and located in the `smart-contract` folder. The contract handles the creation, update, and querying of assets with attributes such as DEALERID, MSISDN, MPIN, BALANCE, STATUS, TRANSAMOUNT, TRANSTYPE, and REMARKS.

### Key Functions

- **CreateAsset**: Creates a new asset.
- **UpdateAsset**: Updates the value of an existing asset.
- **QueryAsset**: Retrieves asset details.
- **GetTransactionHistory**: Returns the transaction history for an asset.

## REST API

The REST API is implemented using **Node.js** and provides endpoints for interacting with the smart contract.

### Endpoints

- **POST /assets**: Create a new asset.
- **PUT /assets/:id**: Update an existing asset.
- **GET /assets/:id**: Retrieve details of an asset.
- **GET /assets/history/:id**: Get transaction history for an asset.

## Usage

1. Use Postman or any API testing tool to interact with the REST API endpoints.
2. Make sure the Hyperledger Fabric test network is up and running before making API calls.
